# AWS SAML to STS Chrome extension

[Google Chrome] extension that intercepts the SAML assertion when logging into
the [AWS] console and exchanges it for temporary [STS] credentials.

<img align="right" width="400" height="329" src="docs/images/click-to-copy.png" alt="Screenshot of the AWS SAML to STS Chrome extension being used to generated temporary credentials.">

In organisations using directory services like Active Directory and
authenticating with AWS through a SAML 2.0 identity provider, there is sometimes
a lack of tooling for generating temporary credentials to use with the [AWS CLI]
or SDKs. This extension makes temporary credentials available for copy whenever
you sign in to the AWS console.

## Getting started

### Installation and usage

Add to Chrome from the [Chrome Web Store].

Sign in to the AWS console as you normally would, once you've signed in, click
the extension icon in the toolbar, choose your preferred platform and click
either of the code snippets to copy the temporary credentials to your clipboard.

Credentials are valid per the duration specified by the identity provider, they
will automatically be removed from local storage when they expire.

### Development and testing

If you want to work on the plugin, or if your organisation blocks access to the
Chrome Web Store, you can build and install the extension manually.

#### Requirements

- [Google Chrome]
- [Node.js] 20 and [npm] 9+

Clone the repository and navigate to the `chrome-ext-aws-saml-sts` directory,
and install dependencies with [npm]. This will take a minute or two.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:unfunco/chrome-ext-aws-saml-sts.git
cd chrome-ext-aws-saml-sts
npm install
```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server
which will watch for changes and rebuild the extension when necessary.

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build
```
